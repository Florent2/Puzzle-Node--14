Discover Social Network
===

This is my solution to the [Puzzle Node exercise #14](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/23).

It has been tested only with Ruby 1.9.

You can get the discovered social network from a tweets input file with the following command:

    $ ./discover_social_network.rb complex_input.txt

To get the result in a file:

    $ ./discover_social_network.rb complex_input.txt > complex_output.txt

Please note that it includes a final empty line.
